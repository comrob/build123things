"""
An extension to the excelent `build123d` by Roger Maitland.
Before you start using this library, please, at least skim through https://github.com/gumyr/build123d
This module contains several utilities to enhance scripted CAD modeling using the said library.
As a starting point, see the docstring of `Thing` or the examples.
For further reference, please read our IROS 2024 paper.

The intent is to provide utilities for systematic and undistracted model coding, not to make hyper-efficient geometry computation.
Of course a good Pythonist can break this library easily.
(E.g., meddling with `__owner__` property or accessing `Thing.__dict__`.)
Perhaps consider this module as a collection of CONVENTIONS of working with the excelent `build123d` library.

    """ A `Thing` is a basic semantic unit of design.
        A `Thing` may have a single resulting body, accessed through `result` method.
        Further it may (and should) be annotated with arbitrary geometric features by setting instance attributes.
        These may be anyting like extrusion profiles, named locations or margin bodies, which are visible for other Things for reference.
        All such geometries are expressed in the `Thing`'s implicit coordinate frame.

        The whole masquerade assumes that the user does not in any case access Thing's `__dict__` directly and uses attribute access as was meant by the Python Gods.
        The `build123d` has a lot of great stuff implemented. Still, to the best of my knowledge, the `build123things` library provides the following conceptual additions:

        Reference Geometry Management:
            - Reference geometries are stored as attributes and they are automatically translated via hijacked attribute access.

        Explicit Semantics:
            - Each `Thing` has to resolve into a single `bd.Part` or `None` via the `result` method, which captures the essence of the `Thing`. If it returns a `Part`, it represents the semantic essence of the Thing. If the `Thing.result()` returns `None`, the `Thing` is useful as a collection of constructive elements or an assembly of other `Thing`s.
            - Joints have explicit semantics.
            - Materials, visual and physical properties are stored unambiguously.
            - It is NOT intended to implement any numerical simulations or kinematics solvers here. Instead, the build123things should offer a way of exporting the Things such that mechanical simulations may be run in different tools.

        Design Parametrizations, Derivations and Alternations:
            - Thing's parameters and their defaults are stored in `__init__`'s params.
            - The particular parameter values are stored with each Thing instance via parameter capture.
            - Named parameter presets or parameter semantic changes are facilitated through subclasses.
            - This is useful to derive different simplified versions of Things, e.g., Screws without Threads or with specialised export methods.
            - One can reinstantiate living object via `alter` method, which allows altering selected parameter values.

        Standardized Assemblies:
            - Attributes of type `bd.Location` define mount points. Mating mounts are aligned with z-axes opposing and x- and y- axes mutually perpendicular. (Rotate x-180deg, y-0deg, z-90deg.)
            - `AbstractJoint` class attaches other Things with arbitrarily parametrized movement.
            - The assembly is a DAG, each `Thing` is the root of its local assembly subtree. Nodes in the tree are Thing's attributes of `AbstractJoint` type.
            - See the ReferenceTransformResolver class.
            - Note: build123d does have assemblies as well, but these are not compatible with build123things.

        Modular Exporting:
            - Export your Thing with all subcomponents to STL files.
            - Export your Thing to MuJoCo description file.

        The parameters are stored in known MRO order.
        Hence, the new_altered can lookup the altered parameters along the real parameter sequence.

        The new_altered may work with parameters altered for different base classes.
        There will be an unification algorithm, which finds the base-most class.

        Imagine there are classes

        - Screw.__init__:(body_diameter, body_length, thread_incline, thread_profile) # The most verbose parametrization in existence.
        - MetricScrew.__init__:(body_diameter, body_length) # Computes the omitted parameters.
        - M2DullScrew.__init__:(body_length, inner_diameter) # Computes the omitted parameters. However, it is also parametrized with something new, which is not known to the base classes.

        A user then instantiates
        s = M2DullScrew(20)

        Finally, the designer wants to derive another Thing. The following may happen:

        s_derived = s.new_altered(body_length__add = 20) # Constructor of M2DullScrew is called.
        s_derived = s.new_altered(body_length__add = 20, body_diameter__mul = 1.5) # This finds the base-most Screw constructor which is called. The resulting Screw is not, however, dull, due to non-pure derivation.
        s_derived = s.new_altered(body_diameter__mul = 1.5, inner_diameter__sub = 0.1) # This fails with ArgumentError because the Screw constructor does not support the inner_diameter parameter.

        The build123things allows having such non-pure Things like M2DullScrew, which break this parameter resolution. The only thing the designer loses is the possibility to call new_altered.

    An assembly is defined by a graph, with nodes=Things and edges=Joints.
    A joint may facilitate any complex motion along any number of independent Things as long as it can evalutate the transform between an arbitrary pair of the two joints.
    A joint is further responsible for maintaining and checking its parametrization, wich is set and evaluated lazily, only on demand.
    The `Thing`s are referenced by their respective selected mount points. The mount points are treated equally unless somehow distinguished in subclass.

    Why a Joint when we can do well enough just with sufficiently parametrizing the Things, do you ask?
        - Because of explicit semantics, the joints are explicitly distinguished from model parametrization.
        - Hence, we may support, e.g., URDF/MJCF exporting.

    Why this, when build123d has its Joints framework?
        - Nicer syntax utilizing the __owner__ references, return values etc.
        - Sound theoretical foundation of the Assembly Directed Acyclic Graph.
        - Easily extensible, separate the technicalities from the movement parametrization.
